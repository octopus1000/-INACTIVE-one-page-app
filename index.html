				<h2>How this app come out?</h2>
				<p>The scence for this page is inside an elevator.The reason I set up such a scene is for switching between different sections. 
				</p>
				<p>I used to use css 3d features(rotate and perspective) to construct the elevator, yet the divs shake when animation trasition performed(when on chrome). I thought about and found that I don't really need a 3D elevator, so I draw on a 2-D canvas instead.</p>

				<h2>Frameworks?</h2>
				<p>No framework is used here. There are three reasons:<br>There isn't much data to be managed. <br>Framework may bring constrains. <br>I'm not familiar with those frameworks and I need some time to handle them.</p>
				<img src="./img/frameworks.png"/>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h2>Libraries and Plugins?</h2>
				<p>I used jquery, it makes codes shorter,might be a little slower. I used Jquery UI to make a shake effect while the elevator is arising, but the shake effect make me uncomfortable and can only shake in horizontal and verticle direction. So I remove it.<p>

			<h2>Why I'm excited about being a front-end developer?</h2>
			<p>I am a strong believer that the future world will be dominated by mobile devices, and web app will be more popular than ever. Cool features added to HTML5 and CSS3 bring efficiency and infinite possibilities. With media queries, I can adjust display with minor changes. When it comes to javascript, it is really easy to use, much easy than c++. With all these cool techniques, I can even make real time 3D rendering using merely a browser.</p>
